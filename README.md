The **Animal Matching Game** is a fun and interactive activity designed to help children improve their object recognition and language skills. In each round, a random animal name is displayed at the top of the screen, and players must select the matching image from a 4x4 grid of animal pictures. Immediate feedback is providedâ€”if the choice is correct, "WIN" is displayed, and if incorrect, "LOSE" appears. The game automatically resets after a brief delay, making it easy to jump into the next round. Featuring dynamic images loaded from a database, the game ensures fresh and engaging gameplay. Built using React, JavaScript, and CSS, it offers a seamless user experience. To get started, install Node.js (v14 or higher), clone the repository from GitHub, install the required dependencies, and start the server. Access the game by navigating to **http://localhost:3000** in your browser and enjoy learning through play!
